# Queue test

Casual research with Queue systems in PHP.  Not even slightly maintained.

To run:

* `git clone` the repository
* Copy `default-.env` to `.env`
* Run `make shell` to start Docker compose and switch into its shell
* Run `composer install`
* Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` to see that the basic demo tests work.
